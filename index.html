<p>As the world population grows the food consumption follows. Given the amount of people roaming on the surface of the earth, food industry is among the largest industries, and it is also among the top industries that make the most money, pushing the wheel of world-economy to spin as it is today. Because in the old days people used to live in poverty, foods are but mere fuel that keep their body moving. But situation has changed, with no more wars and the peaceful environment established in most countries “food” become more important. Food defines culture, and sometimes wellbeing of a country. </p>

<p>As the saying “you are what you eat” goes, we do strongly believe that in order to live a happy life, one needs healthy food. After all you will at least need a healthy body in order to be happy; it is something that cannot be bought with money. This is particularly why we are choosing organic products – or in this specific case, organic rice – as our main topic. Our aims are to provide a better understand of organic foods and providing the reason why organic foods are better than ordinary mass produced foods.  </p>
