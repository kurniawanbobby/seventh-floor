 **STUDENT REPORT**

 *10 Minutes: Report on the current progress regarding thesis, projects, etc.*

This past week I have been mainly focusing on researching possible applications of Game Theory and Idea Flow in XLP-related work. I have started 2 courses on Game Theory on Coursera to learn more about Game Theory and am continuously gaining more knowledge on GT. I have also did more research on the concept of Idea Flow by Pentland and reviewed most of his previous research papers and publications mentioned in "Social Physics". I found that one of the backbones behind Idea Flow concept is the Influence model developed by Pentland and his students. It is described in detail in the paper by Wen Dong in "[Influence Modeling of Complex Stochastic Processes](http://vismod.media.mit.edu/vismod/demos/influence-model/wdong06thesis.pdf)".

**Social Physics**

-	Idea flow -> Influence model
-	Influence model: Prob(ht(c')|ht-1(1),...ht-1(C)) = âˆ‘c=(1,...,C)Rc'c x Prob(ht(c')|ht-1(c))
	-	Idea flow across social ties can influence behavior
	-	SP suggests 2 influence models for fast and slow thinking

**Game Theory**

-	Little research available on Moving Targets in the way that applies to XLP
-	Existing research consider military games where ships need to send missiles at each other, while they all (and thus the targets) are moving within the given area.
-	Idea flow through influence model and game theory share similar mathematical foundations. Possibility to further develop the idea flow model in a game setting.

**Small-world Networks**

- Relates directly to Idea Flow and Influence model.
- Considering small networks can help to develop a more accurate R influence matrix between the agents.



**FEEDBACK **

 *10 Minutes: Professor's feedback regarding student's current progress.*

When using Game Theory approach, the notion of digital publishing has to be emphasized. Thus, interactions between agents have to consider the social contracts with different payout tables and see how each contract affects the following states. Then the process can be iterated and in the sense we are designning a model of computation. In many cases, a model of computation can be best embodied by a computable language.

[Mathematica](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/search.html?query=game%20theory) is a good platform for designing the game model. It can provide dynamic graphical figures that can be used effectively for presentation. The experiments need to be conducted to test the model. The possible experiments can be done within GMS and IGS courses this semester at Tsinghua.

[Solr search engine](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) can be incorporated into the XLP platform to index all files and provide search options within all the previous XLP files and data to provide relevant references for participants.

Based on previous XLP experiences, challenge designer roles need to be reconsidered. Either through providing additional training or through introduction of competition and/or grading system or other incentives, their motivation should be increased in order to provide a better learning environment. They should be encouraged to use a single platform (Git) and develop relevant workflows, which will allow for more convenient and rich data collection.

**OPEN BUSINESS**

*10 Minutes: Open discussion of current and future business*

- **Master Thesis**
	- Timeline: 3 months (March - May)
	- Scope: Identify a specific area within our work with XLP
		- Game Theory + Idea Flow/Influence model
		- XLP Evaluation Framework
		- Git GUI usability test

**COMMITMENTS**

*5 Minutes: Plans and schedules for future work and follow-ups*


***Kuba***:

- Research on game theory models development in Mathematica
- Continue MOOC courses on Game Theory
- Explore Solr search engine installation process


***Ben***:
- You need to find a place to store all the downloaded papers that you are reviewing, so that others can easily find those papers in the future.
- I made some modifications in your minutes, you can see them using the DIFF feature.
- You need to help Echo and Leonadis to use the same way to document meetings on Git.
- We need to consolidate all data collection using Git. For large data files, such as Video files, we need to find a way to manage them either using Git or some other file sharing platforms.
- A script designed to extract data collected from Git database, and a way to convert informatino to be searched using LUCENE/Solr of Apache would be a necessary feature for the next XLP session. We need to start planning for that.
- We still need to write a Positioning Paper for XLP, using the Logic Model as a part of our activity and program design methodology.
